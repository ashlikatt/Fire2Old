# Data Types
Fire provides several different data types to use in your code, and ways of creating your own. 


## Number
---
Numbers are the simplest possible type.
They can be created just by writing down something like `1.0`.
Numbers can have underscores anywhere inside of them for readability. `1_000_000.0` is valid!

### Int
Integers are a subset of Numbers. They're easily created by writing something like `1` or `8`.
Integers will be automatically converted to Numbers if needed, but not the other way around.


## String
--- 
Strings are extremely basic, they can be created `"by typing something like this"` or `'like this'`.
Strings can be escaped using `\`. This can be used to achieve newlines.

Percent codes will be accepted by diamondfire within strings, however they're heavily discouraged because they can affect the integrity and safety of the typing and selection system. (This goes for any % code)
